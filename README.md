# Presentation
Single page [React](https://fr.react.dev/) todo app with 3 categories for work, hobbies and domestic labor. 
The application is responsive, it has light and dark themes and horrible orange tones ;)

# Requirements
- JavaScript execution environment like [node](https://nodejs.org/en), [deno](https://deno.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) (**node** prefered)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with both node and deno)
- This repo ;)

At the root of the repository, open a terminal and use the command :
```sh
npm i
```

# Launch and update
Still at the root of the repository, after you installed the dependencies use the command :
```sh
npm run dev
```
to run the [Vite](https://vite.dev/) server. Now, you can try the app and modify it live.

# Building and testing
If you want to try the app on it's full potential, you can build and preview it :
```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```
Also useful if you want to deploy it with your own solution.

# Vercel
Fortunately, you can try the app without any installments thanks to a vercel solution <https://todo-app-mocha-sigma-61.vercel.app/>
